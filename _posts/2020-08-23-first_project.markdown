This first CLI project has clarified one thing to me that I’ve known most of my life but have tried to ignore; I doubt myself too much. I got overwhelmed and questioned myself at every turn to the point that I was nearly convinced I was a failure and would never achieve anything great in life. However, once I swallowed my pride and actually asked for help from my cohort lead I realized that I knew so much more than I allowed myself to see. 

I went with books as my main subject because I’m a bit of a bookworm. The basics of it is the user is welcomed, then prompted to type in a subject they’re curious about, a list of ten books will populate about that subject, and when they select a title they will be given more information on the book. In theory I knew this was simple enough. But finding an API that worked was honestly infuriating. Did you realize that not all APIs need a key?! I didn’t. And when I found out I about lost it but it was a solid learning experience and one that I won’t forget anytime soon. 

The biggest issue for me with this project wasn’t the coding itself, or even the six(yes, six) hours I spent trying to find an API that worked. It was the constant overthinking and doubting myself. I’m not good at asking for help. I hate inconveniencing people but that is not going to fly if I want to be a Software Engineer. I learned a lot through this project in regards to coding but I also learned that I need to stop being so hard on myself, trust the process, and ask for help early on, not a couple hours before the project is due(sorry Juan).
