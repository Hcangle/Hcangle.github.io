JavaScript is a beast, a beast that fuels imposter syndrome. But as much as this project has kicked my butt(more so than any other project up to this point) I was determined to get it done. 
I love the potential of JavaScript and I know what I’ve built is barely a taste of its capabilities. But I can confidently say, I can only go up from here. 

Disney Day is an app that helps you build your perfect Disney outing. It is a single page web app that feeds off of my love (and honestly, obsession) of Disney. 

You’re able to choose from a handful of drop downs what you would like your Disney day to look like. From shopping, shows, rides, photo opportunities, and places to eat. A simple application that caused an embarrassing amount of tears. I had issues with getting my backend to communicate with my frontend, typos, properly building nested routes, but more than anything my issue was self doubt. 

A theme with all projects unfortunately. It’s amazing how coding has such high highs and low lows but that’s all part of the process. Learning to embrace the uncomfortable and push through. Study where I need to, take a breath when I’m getting worked up. 

Overall, I have so much to learn and there’s still a lot of growth to be had. But I am thankful for the challenges. And I know I’ll look back at this project and be able to see it as a start, not an obstacle, towards my future in coding.
