I decided to study Software Engineering because I wanted to create opportunities for myself. I was stuck at a job I didn’t like and living a life that was mediocre at best. 

When I stumbled upon Software Engineering I was immediately intrigued. I saw a challenge, I saw a potential income that meant I could take care of myself, and I saw possibilities. I felt like I was looking through a crack in a wall before but when I realized Software Engineering was a potential for me, suddenly a door appeared. So I walked through it. 

I chose Software Engineering because it will help me live the life I want to live. A life where I don’t have to worry about paying my bills on time. A life where I am constantly challenged and growing. A life that gives me some freedom outside of a typical nine to five should I choose not to pursue that route. 

I chose Software Engineering because I saw opportunity.
